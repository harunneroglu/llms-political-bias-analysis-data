Political Bias Analysis Dataset for ChatGPT and DeepSeek

Objective:
This dataset was created as part of a research project aimed at analyzing political biases in large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The primary goal of the study is to assess the ideological tendencies of these models by evaluating their responses to 62 political statements derived from the Political Compass questionnaire.

Methodology:
The dataset contains responses collected from ChatGPT and DeepSeek under three distinct geopolitical contexts: Neutral (default), USA-based, and China-based. Each statement was presented 100 times in each context using a bootstrapped sampling method to ensure statistical reliability. The responses were then mapped onto two-dimensional coordinates (economic and social axes) and normalized to allow direct comparison. Model-centered coordinates and Z-scores were also calculated to highlight deviations from each model's average behavior.
